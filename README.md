# ðŸŒ³ Happy-Trees ðŸŒ²

Happy Trees is a simple ASCII File Tree Generator.

It runs in the browser and helps you generate simple ASCII directory structures for sharing in your README files, markdown or other text-based documentation.

# Why Happy Trees?

I know that there is `brew install tree` and all that fancy linux stuff you can do to generate these, but I wanted something quick and dirty without the need to build out a file/folder structure and then generate. You can simply just make markdown lists and copy them into whatever docs you're writing.

Also, [Bob Ross](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLO7tCdBVrA&list=RD0n4f-VDjOBE&index=5) is awesome. ;)
